## Introduction

In recent years, Chinese lingerie brands have gained significant attention in the fashion world. Their unique blend of Chinese aesthetics, modern style, and sustainable practices have captivated consumers globally. Now, these innovative brands are making their way to the heart of Manhattan, New York City. Here, in the fashion capital of the world, they are redefining the lingerie industry and challenging traditional perceptions of femininity and sexuality.

## The Origins of Chinese Lingerie Brands in Manhattan

The journey of Chinese lingerie brands in Manhattan began with the iconic White Rabbit candy. Originally featuring the "ABC Mickey Mouse" mascot, the candy factory later changed its branding to a jumping white rabbit logo. This transition occurred after the factory's nationalization, where the use of western imagery was deemed politically problematic. 

Chop Suey Club, a Chinese art and design store based in Chinatown, Manhattan, took inspiration from Edward Hopper's famous painting, "Chop Suey." This painting, sold for a record-breaking $92 million in 2018, portrays two women dining alone, symbolizing the changes in American society during the Roaring Twenties.

## Pillowbook: Redefining Chinese Style  

One of the prominent Chinese lingerie brands making waves in Manhattan is Pillowbook. Founded by Irene Lu, a Beijing-born designer, Pillowbook aims to reinvent Chinese aesthetics and accentuate the beauty of the Asian physique. Lu believes that Asian girls are not given enough credit for their sexiness, and Pillowbook seeks to change that perception.

### The Power of Dudou

At the heart of Pillowbook's success lies the dudou, a classic Chinese intimate wear. Lu's special lingerie design, the dudou, has been a bestseller since the brand's inception. This traditional Chinese garment is brought to life with a modern twist, combining luxurious silk and delicate embroidery. Each piece is meticulously handmade, showcasing the brand's commitment to detail and craftsmanship.

### Modern Chinese Style Revived

Pillowbook embodies modern Chinese style, embracing a strong femininity that comes in every shape, size, and form. The brand's lingerie designs celebrate individuality and empower women to feel confident and sexy. Through its unique blend of traditional Chinese elements and contemporary fashion, Pillowbook has become a symbol of the evolving perceptions of beauty and style in China.

## 4. The End: Sustainable and Edgy  

Another Chinese lingerie brand making a splash in Manhattan is The End. Designed by Taiwanese model Beikuo, who graduated from Parsons New School Of Design, The End brings a fresh perspective to sustainable fashion. The brand exclusively uses organic cotton, prioritizing environmental consciousness without compromising style. 

### Quirk and Kink in Sustainable Fashion

The End's designs exude a sense of edginess and playfulness. With a focus on sustainability, the brand combines innovative designs with quirky details, catering to those who embrace their quirks and fetishes. The End challenges societal norms and encourages self-expression through fashion, embracing the beauty of imperfections.

### Embracing Imperfections

In the world of lingerie, The End believes that imperfections are what make us human. The brand celebrates uniqueness and encourages individuals to embrace their flaws and quirks. By showcasing lingerie that goes beyond traditional notions of perfection, The End aims to redefine beauty standards and promote self-acceptance.

## Provocative Perceptions: Changing Attitudes towards Lingerie

The rise of Chinese lingerie brands in Manhattan reflects a broader shift in societal attitudes towards lingerie and sexuality. In the past, instances of "indecent exposure" would have been deemed inappropriate. However, the rise of feminism in the 1920s led to gradual changes in these perceptions. Restaurants began posting signs that read "Tables for Ladies," signaling a shift towards a more inclusive and accepting society.

Chinese lingerie brands draw inspiration from their rich cultural heritage, infusing traditional Chinese elements into their designs. Symbolism and embroidery play a significant role in creating unique and visually stunning lingerie pieces. Luxurious silk and delicate details showcase the beauty and elegance of Chinese aesthetics.

### Symbolism and Embroidery

Chinese culture is steeped in symbolism, and this is reflected in the intricate embroidery found in Chinese lingerie designs. Each stitch tells a story, conveying meanings of luck, prosperity, and love. From delicate floral patterns to intricate dragon motifs, these designs pay homage to Chinese traditions and craftsmanship.

### Luxurious Silk and Delicate Details

Silk has long been associated with luxury and elegance in Chinese culture. Chinese lingerie brands embrace this tradition, using luxurious silk fabrics to create sensual and comfortable pieces.
